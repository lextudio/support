Azure Architecture & Modernization Service
==========================================

If you are planning new workloads on Microsoft Azure or modernizing existing
on-premises / IaaS systems, this service helps you design, validate, and
implement a secure, performant, and cost‑efficient architecture.

Scope Highlights
----------------
* Landing zone review (subscription, resource groups, network segmentation, governance).
* Identity & access alignment (Entra ID role design, managed identities, least privilege review).
* Compute platform decisions (App Service, Container Apps, AKS, Functions, Batch) with trade‑off analysis.
* Data layer architecture (Azure SQL / PostgreSQL, Cosmos DB, Storage, Event Hubs, Service Bus, Cache for Redis).
* Networking & connectivity (Private Endpoints, Application Gateway/WAF, Front Door, VPN/ExpressRoute considerations).
* Observability foundation (Monitor, Log Analytics, Distributed Tracing, Alerts, dashboards, cost anomaly detection).
* Deployment automation (Bicep/Terraform design review, GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps pipelines hardening, environment promotion strategy).
* Resilience & performance (availability targets, autoscale, regional failover patterns, chaos testing recommendations).
* Cost optimization (reserved capacity, savings plans, rightsizing, lifecycle / data tiering strategies, FinOps practices).

Engagement Model
----------------
1. Discovery workshop to capture current state, constraints, compliance drivers, and success criteria.
2. Architecture working sessions with iterative diagrams (logical, deployment, data flow, security trust boundaries).
3. Written recommendations & prioritized remediation or implementation backlog.
4. Optional pairing on implementation (infrastructure as code, CI/CD, monitoring dashboards, performance tuning).
5. Final review, knowledge transfer, and follow‑up checkpoint.

Deliverables
------------
* Baseline & target architecture diagrams (PNG + source where applicable).
* Security & governance gap assessment with actionable items.
* Cost risk & optimization report (estimated impact ranges where measurable).
* Deployment pipeline & infrastructure as code review notes.
* Optional: reference Bicep/Terraform module patterns, sample GitHub Actions workflows, policy starter pack.
