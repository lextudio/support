Professional Support Services
-----------------------------
Professional Support is available as a single "pay-per-incident" (PPI) or an
annual contract with five incidents. Professional Support incidents focus on
troubleshooting a specific problem, error message, or functionality that is not
working as intended for our products. An incident is defined as a single
support issue and the reasonable effort to resolve it. Incidents may be
submitted online. Response time will be between 2 and 8 hours, depending on
severity of incident.
